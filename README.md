# Tartarus V2 Keymap for Sculpting
## Overview

This is my keymap for the Razer Tartarus V2 for use when sculpting with a drawing tablet in Blender. I'm new to sculpting so this helps me keep my hands on the pad and not having to reach for keys every time i need to do something.

## The Keymap

This is my simple map of things I'm assuming I'll need for basic editing, with a Hypershift key for extras.
Please let me know if you have suggestions, or if you have a map that you'd like to share.
